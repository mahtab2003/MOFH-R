### SMTP
Here are some widely used SMTP services. They have free plans with some limitations, most importantly though, they are compatible with MOFH-R.
- [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/). 
> **Note**  
> Mailgun seems to offer only a trial plan for a month, and without adding a credit card you are only authorized to send emails to 5 recipients. Therefore, you may want to choose another service.
- [Mailjet](https://mailjet.com/).
- [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/free/).
